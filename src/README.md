# Tux Game

This project is a simple web-based game featuring a penguin character that can be moved using the keyboard's cursor keys. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without any large frameworks or build steps.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML document that sets up the structure of the game, including the SVG or canvas element for rendering the penguin character and the background.
- `style.css`: Contains styles for the game, including layout, background, and visual effects for the penguin character.
- `game.js`: Handles the game logic, including rendering the penguin character, handling keyboard input for movement, and updating the game state.

## How to Run the Game

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the penguin character around the screen.

## Development Notes

- The game is designed to be simple and lightweight, making it easy to understand and modify.
- Future enhancements could include adding obstacles, scoring, and more interactive elements.
